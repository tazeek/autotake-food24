    "# Completion (02nd October 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Intake24 empty nutrition code (\"N/A\") -> Currently, filtered them out.\n",
    "- Intake24 unmatched codes (\"8416\") -> Currently, left them out of calculations. (Helped answer a question)\n",
    "- Improved efficiency in reading of all three files (Intake24: from 20s to almost 1s)\n",
    "- Calculation(s) on non-recipes done (Example: shown in notebook)\n",
    "- Skipping on food group: water\n",
    "- Breakdown of granular recipes done\n",
    "\n",
    "# Clarifications\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which one to take: energy with fibre or energy without fibre? (applies for both intake24 and HEIFA)\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is \"Energy, with dietary fibre (kJ) per 100g\"? How is it different from serving size and serving measure?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is it okay to drop rows where the Nutrient ID is N/A?\n",
    "\n",
    "- What about cases when the Nutrient ID doesn't match? (Example: 8416)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Questions to Ask\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current output is: Print output. Anything specific you'd want to see?\n",
    "- How do we breakdown the ingredients, which are recipes and consists of recipes?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Nutrition ID ABC (from Intake 24) has portion size of 150g\n",
    "- It belongs to recipe D, which has 5 components: E F G H I\n",
    "- One of the components I, has proportion of 0.60\n",
    "- However I is a recipe itself.\n",
    "- So: should we use the proportion of I for calculation or break it down further?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Former**: 0.60 * 150 \\\n",
    "**Latter**: use sub-components and multiply with 150g\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively and logically: \n",
    "- It makes sense to use the sub-components (latter) as it gives a more granular and accurate representation.\n",
    "- It is consistent with the other calculations as well (the ones that don't have recipes themselves but are ingredients)."
